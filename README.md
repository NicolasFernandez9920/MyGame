# Trump’s Great Adventure – 2D Platformer (C++ / SFML)

## Overview
A 2D platformer game developed in C++ using SFML, focused on gameplay mechanics, state management, and collision systems.

The player collects a red-hat power-up that allows him to convert protesters into followers while navigating platforming obstacles to reach the White House.

## Gameplay Features
- 2D movement with gravity and collision detection
- Power-up mechanic (hat projectile)
- Enemy-to-follower conversion system
- Win condition based on follower count
- Scene management (Menu, Gameplay, Ending)
- Hazard system (spikes)

## Visual & Asset Design
All gameplay sprites were designed by me:
- Player character
- Protesters
- Power-up item
- Platforms and blocks
- Spikes
- White House sprite

Background image, sound effects, and music were sourced from free asset libraries.

## Technologies
- C++
